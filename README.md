# Emailing
Sending and receiving emails using python. 
<br>Finest UI optimization python can offer(not muchðŸ˜”)


**Sending**
>Can send email with subject and body.<br>
>Putting double spaces will be rendered as a new line. However, this only works using this emailing program and will not be rendered using gmail, outlook, or other emailing programs.<br>

**Receiving**

>Lists 10 newest emails you have recieved with the email's sender, receiver, and subject. Number of emails displayed can be changed<br>
>Asks you which email you want to open using the email's subject.<br>
>Once opened, it will display the email using utf-8 encoder and custom formatter

**Formatter**

>Custom formatter replaces double spaces as a new line.<br>
>Can make custom abbreviations using `.replace()`.<br>


**Coming soon**

>Being abe to send line breaks and new lines that can be rendered and displayed on all email platforms(gmail, outlook, etc.). Currently only option is to put two spaces and will only be rendered on this program using the formatter
