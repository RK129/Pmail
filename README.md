Sending and receiving emails using python. 
<br>Finest UI optimization python can offer(not muchðŸ˜”)


**Sending**

>Will send abbreviations that can be custom made using `.replace()` in the formatter. <br>
>Example: "OMW" is sent as "on my way"

**Receiving**

>Lists 10 newest emails you have recieved with the email's sender, receiver, and subject. Number of emails displayed can be changed<br>
>Asks you which email you want to open using the email's subject.<br>
>Once opened, it will display the email using utf-8 encoder and custom formatter.

**Formatter**

>Replaces double spaces with a new line. 
>Renders abbreviations using  `.replace()`. 


**Coming soon**
